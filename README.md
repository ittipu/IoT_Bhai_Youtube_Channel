# IoT Lab 

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **IoT Lab**! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains all the code and resources used in the experiments and tutorials featured on my YouTube channel. Whether you're a beginner exploring IoT or an experienced developer, you'll find projects and examples to enhance your IoT journey.

## About the Channel
**IoT Lab** is dedicated to simplifying Internet of Things (IoT) concepts, projects, and tutorials. We cover:

- IoT development using ESP32, Arduino, and other microcontrollers.
- GSM, GPS, LoRa, and Modbus communication.
- Integrating sensors like DHT22, SI7021, MAX17043, and HMC5883L.
- Cloud platforms, MQTT, and Blynk.
- Robotics projects for kids and beginners.

All videos are designed to help you learn and implement IoT solutions step-by-step, especially in **Bangla**!
